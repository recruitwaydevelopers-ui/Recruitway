                        <h4>The Growing Threat in Technical Interviews</h4>
                        <p>The job market is becoming increasingly competitive, and with remote hiring on the rise, a new type of fraud has emerged—deepfake scams in technical interviews. Companies conducting virtual interviews now face candidates using deepfake technology to manipulate their appearance and even voice in real time. This allows impostors to either appear as someone else or have another person answer interview questions on their behalf.</p>
                        <h4>How Deepfake Technology is Used in Interviews</h4>
                        <p>Deepfake technology, which leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), can generate highly realistic audio and video manipulations. In the context of job interviews, fraudsters employ deepfakes in several ways:</p>
                        <ul className='single-list-inner style-check style-heading style-check mb-3'>
                          <li>
                            1. Smarter Candidate Sourcing:
                          </li>
                          <p>A candidate may use deepfake software to overlay another person’s face onto their own in real-time, making it appear as if someone else is attending the interview.</p>
                          <li>
                            2. Voice Cloning:
                          </li>
                          <p>AI-powered voice synthesis tools allow candidates to mimic another individual’s voice, helping them match their falsified identity.</p>
                          <li>
                            3. Pre-Recorded Responses: 
                          </li>
                           <p>Some scammers pre-record answers to expected technical questions and play them while mimicking lip movements.</p>
                          <li>
                          4. Dual Participation:  
                          </li>
                         <p>One person appears on camera while another individual, usually an expert, provides answers in the background via voice-altering software.</p>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Real-World Cases of Deepfake Interview Fraud</h4>
                        <p>Several high-profile cases have emerged where companies unknowingly hired individuals who used deepfake technology during interviews. In some instances, these fraudsters were hired into sensitive roles, such as IT or cybersecurity, only to later be discovered as unqualified. Companies such as the FBI have issued warnings about this rising threat.</p>
                        <h4>Impact on Businesses</h4>
